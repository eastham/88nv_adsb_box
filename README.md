<h2>88nv_adsb_box: modifications to the adsb-exchange image to support operations at 88NV.</h2>

Files in here enable:
- Logging of all aircraft seen at 1/5 Hz
- Support for a small OLED (SSD1306) display that shows system status and IP address
- Support for an illuminated button that allows easy reset of the wifi setup to stock each year (maybe not needed if we switch to Ethernet)
- Overlay of runway and city coordinates (maybe should be moved to the fork of tar1090 at https://github.com/eastham/tar1090)
